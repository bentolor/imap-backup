# Migrate to a new e-mail server while keeping your existing address

While switching e-mail provider (from provider `A` to `B`), you might want to keep the same address (`mymail@domain.com`), and restrieve all your existing e-mails on your new server `B`. `imap-backup` can do that too!

1. Backup your e-mails: use [`imap-backup setup`](/docs/commands/setup.md) to setup connection to your old provider `A`, then launch [`imap-backup backup`](/docs/commands/backup.md). 
1. Actually switch your e-mail service provider (update your DNS MX and all that...).
1. It is best to use [`imap-backup migrate`](/docs/commands/migrate.md) and not [`imap-backup restore`](/docs/commands/restore.md) here, but both the source and the destination have the same address... You need to manually rename your old account first:

	1. Modify your configuration file manually (i.e. not via `imap-backup setup`) and rename your account to `mymail-old@domain.com`:

		```diff
		"accounts": [
		{
		-	"username": "mymail@domain.com",
		+	"username": "mymail-old@domain.com",
			"password": "...",
		-	"local_path": "/some/path/.imap-backup/mymail_domain.com",
		+	"local_path": "/some/path/.imap-backup/mymail-old_domain.com",
			"folders": [...],
			"server": "..."
		}
		```

	1. Rename the backup directory from `mymail_domain.com` to `mymail-old_domain.com`.

1. Set up a new account giving access to the new provider `B` using `imap-backup setup`.
1. Now you can use `imap-backup migrate`, optionnally adapting [delimiters and prefixes configuration](/docs/delimiters-and-prefixes.md) if need be:

		imap-backup migrate mymail-old@domain.com mymail@domain.com [options]
