# Restore

```sh
imap-backup restore EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

All missing messages are pushed to the IMAP server.
Existing messages are left unchanged.

This functionality requires that the IMAP server supports the UIDPLUS
extension to IMAP4.

# FAQ

## How does restore work?

Backed-up emails are pushed to the IMAP server.
If there are clashes, folders are renamed.

## What are all these 'INBOX.12345' files?

If, when the backup is launched, the IMAP server contains a folder with
the same name, but different history to the local backup, the local
emails cannot simply be added to the existing folder.

In this case, a numeric suffix is added to the **local** folder,
before it is restored.

In this way, old and new emails are kept separate.

## Will my email get overwritten?

No.

Emails are identified by folder and a specific email id. Any email that
is already on the server is skipped.

## How to restore e-mails to a new service while keeping the same e-mail address?

If you are switching to a new e-mail provider, but want to keep your existing e-mail address, it is best to use the [`migrate`](/docs/commands/migrate.md) command instead of `restore`. See [this guide on the topic](/docs/migrate-server-keep-address.md).
